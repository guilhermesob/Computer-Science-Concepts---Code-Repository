# Tanenbaum-s-Computer-Science-Concepts---Code-Repository
practical implementations and mathematical explorations inspired by the seminal works of Professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum. This repository is designed to reinforce and showcase my deep understanding of computer science concepts, particularly those covered in Computer Networks (5th Edition) and Structured Computer Organization.
Systems Analyst and Developer and Software Engineer, I believe in continuous learning and hands-on practice to maintain and enhance my technical expertise. This repository serves as a testament to my commitment to these principles, featuring code implementations that explore the core ideas presented in these textbooks.

## Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:

## Computer Networks:

Implementations and simulations of networking protocols, algorithms, and concepts discussed in Computer Networks.

Mathematical models and code related to network throughput, latency calculations, and other performance metrics.

## Structured Computer Organization:

Code that demonstrates the workings of computer architecture as described in Structured Computer Organization.
Projects that cover topics such as microprogramming, assembly language programming, and memory management.
Mathematical Equations and Models:

Scripts and programs that solve complex mathematical equations encountered in computer science and network engineering.
Examples include numerical methods for network analysis, signal processing, and data encryption.
